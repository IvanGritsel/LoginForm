Task 16. Create an authentication form
Authentication form must contain email and password fields. Password typing should be hidden. Enable the submit button
only if all fields are filled in together with the correct email. Don't use AJAX to send requests to the back-end.
Authenticate user over the file below:

```
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

return [
    'user1@test.com' => [
        'name' => 'John',
        'password' => 'your_hash_here1', // use password_hash() to generate
            password in your code
    ],
    'user2@test.com' => [
        'name' => 'Jane',
        'password' => 'your_hash_here2', // use password_hash() to generate
            password in your code
    ],
];
```

If the user authenticated successfully, greet him by message 'Welcome back, {user name}!'. If no,
show the message 'Login is incorrect.'.
You should implement this application in OOP. Implement MVC pattern for this application. For the View part you must use
the Twig Template Engine, loaded through Composer. Use separate CSS files for styles.
